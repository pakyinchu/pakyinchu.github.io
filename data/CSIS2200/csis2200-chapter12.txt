Structured decisions can be automated because a well-defined standard operating procedure exists
Examples of structured decisions are record keeping, payroll
Semistructured decisions are not as well-defined but include a structured aspect
Examples of semistructured decisions are sales forecasting, budget preparation
Unstructured decisions are one-time decisions with no standard operating procedure
Decision maker’s intuition plays an important role in unstructured decisions
Example of unstructured decisions are executive information system
Challenges in semistructured and unstructured decisions are multiple criteria and users have to choose between conflicting objectives
Management support systems (MSSs) are different types of information systems that have been developed to support certain aspects and types of decisions
In strategic management, introduction of a new product is an example of unstructured decision
In strategic management, mergers are an example of semistructured decision
In strategic management, plant location is an example of structured decision
In tactical management, resolving conflicts between two divisions are an example of unstructured decision
In tactical management, sales forecast is an example of unstructured decision
In tactical management, budget preparation is an example of structured decision
In operational management, setting queue priorities is an unstructured decision
In operational management, accounts receivable is an example of semistructured decision
In operational management, payroll is an example of structured decision
Economist Herbert Simon defined three phases in decision making: Intelligence phase, Design phase, Choice phase
A fourth phase can be added in the decision making process Economist Herbert Simon defined which is the implementation phase
The intelligence phase examine the organization’s environment for conditions that need decisions
The intelligence phase collect and process data from a variety of sources
The intelligence phase allows decision maker to discover ways to approach the problem
The intelligence phase identify what is going on, then get a better understanding, and finally identify alternative solutions
The design phase defines the criteria for making a decision and generates alternatives for meeting the criteria
The design phase defines associations between the criteria and the alternatives and requires understanding how each alternative affects the criteria
Information technology does not support the design phase
Collaboration and video-conferencing systems can be helpful for the design phase
The choice phase selects the best and most effective course of action
The choice phase requires analyzing each alternative and its relationship to the criteria
A decision support system (DSS) can support the choice phase
DSS helps sort through possible solutions to choose the best one for the organization
DSS includes tools for calculating cost-benefit ratios
The implementation phase devises a plan for carrying out the selected choice and obtain resources to implement
In the implementation phase, ideas are converted into actions
In the implementation phase, DSS does a follow-up assessment on how well a solution is performing
Decision support system (DSS) is an interactive information system designed to assist decision makers in an organization
DSS includes Hardware, Software, Data, Mathematical and statistical models
One of the requirements of decision support systems is be interactive and incorporate human element as well as hardware and software
One of the requirements of decision support systems is to use internal and external data
One of the requirements of decision support systems is to include mathematical and statistical models
One of the requirements of decision support systems is to support decision makers at all levels
One of the requirements of decision support systems is to emphasize semistructured and unstructured tasks
Components of Decision Support Systems include database, model base, and user interface
Database includes internal and external data and a database management system (DBMS) which enables a DSS to perform data analysis
Model base includes mathematical and statistical models which enable a DSS to analyze information
User interface allow users to access the DSS
DSS includes features to support decision making by What-if analysis, Goal-seeking, Sensitivity analysis, Exception reporting analysis, Optimization analysis
Other DSS includes features include Graphical analysis, forecasting, simulation, statistical analysis, and modeling analysis
The role Users is crucial because they use the DSS
The role Users may include department or organizational units in addition to people
Managerial designer defines the management issues in designing and using a DSS
Managerial designer addresses questions like what type of data to collect and from what sources
Managerial designer addresses questions like how to organize data and how recent should data be and how to update them
Managerial designer addresses questions like balance between aggregated and disaggregated data
Technical designer focuses on how the DSS is implemented
Technical designer addresses questions data storage, File structure, User access, Response time, Security measures
Model builder is the liaison between users and designers
Model builder is responsible for supplying information including what the model does, what data inputs the model accepts, how the model’s output should be interpreted, and what assumptions go into creating and using the model
Value may be a more useful measure than cost for DDSs
One of the benefits of DDSs is the increased number of alternatives examined
One of the benefits of DDSs is fast response to unexpected situations
One of the benefits of DDSs is the ability to make one-of-a-kind decisions
One of the benefits of DDSs is the new insights and learning generated
One of the benefits of DDSs is improved communication, control, and decisions
One of the benefits of DDSs is cost and time savings
One of the benefits of DDSs is effective teamwork and use of data resources
Executive information system (EIS) gives executives easy access to DDS data
Most Executive information system (EIS) includes a digital dashboard that integrates information from multiple sources and presents it in a unified, understandable format
One of the important characteristics of an EIS is tailored to management’s information needs
One of the important characteristics of an EIS is ability to track and present critical data in multiple formats
One of the important characteristics of an EIS is the provision of online access and analysis tools
One of the important characteristics of an EIS is accessibility of both internal and external data
One of the important characteristics of an EIS is the supports for electronic communication
EISs provide managers with analytical and decision-making tools 
EISs include graphical representations of data that help executives make critical decisions
EISs let executives share information with others quickly and easily
EISs enable managers to improve efficiency and effectiveness in decision making
Organizational resistance to the project is one of the factors that lead to a failed EIS
Perception that the project is unimportant is one of the factors that lead to a failed EIS
Lack or loss of interest from management is one of the factors that lead to a failed EIS
Inability to define objectives and information or meet objectives is one of the factors that lead to a failed EIS
System’s objectives are not linked to factors critical to the organization’s success is one of the factors that lead to a failed EIS
Project’s costs cannot be justified is one of the factors that lead to a failed EIS
Development time is too long or system is too complicated is one of the factors that lead to a failed EIS
Vendor support has been discontinued is one of the factors that lead to a failed EIS
Lack of understanding of executives’ needs leads to lack of relevant information is one of the factors that lead to a failed EIS
Geographic Information System (GIS) captures, stores, and analyses data to inform location-related decision making
Two major component of a GIS are digitized maps and spatially oriented databases
Geographic Information System (GIS) performs tasks that require complex geographical context associating spatial attributes with places on a map and integrate map data with a query
GIS with analytical capability interprets spatial data to evaluate impact of a decision, example: Google Maps
GIS Applications include education planning, urban planning, Government, Insurance, Marketing, Real estate, Transportation and logistics
Collaboration Systems is a type of software that assists group decision-makers by providing access to shared environment and information
Potential advantages of Collaboration Systems is that it enables a decision maker to easily communicate and coordinate with team, increases productivity and effectiveness, facilitates teamwork, saves time, reduces travel-related costs and stress
Potential disadvantages Collaboration Systems is that it lacks human touch and other nonverbal cues, Unnecessary meetings, Security problems
Success of Collaboration Systems depends on Matching the GSS’s level and sophistication to the group’s size and the scope of the task
Success of Collaboration Systems depends on providing supportive management that is willing to champion using a GSS in the organization
Collaboration Systems can be either synchronous or asynchronous
Three broad groups of collaboration systems: Communication software, Task management software, and Document and content management software
Communication software lets participants communicate and share files
Task management software lets participants prioritize and track tasks
Document and content management software lets participants share and work together on different files
Collaboration software can include many components, and you may need only a few
The most expensive collaboration software may not be the right choice for you
Consider frequency of updates and patches, user groups, and support offered when choosing the right collaboration software
You should define your needs, compare prices, and evaluate vendor support when choosing the Right Collaboration Software
