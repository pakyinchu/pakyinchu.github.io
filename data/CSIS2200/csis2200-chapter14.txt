Recent trends in software and service distribution include the following: Pull technology, Push technology, Application service providers
Pull technology has been around since the Web begin
Pull technology is when a user states a need (makes a request) before getting information

Push technology improves business relations and customer service
Examples of push technology includes the following: Microsoft Azure Notification Hubs, Apple Push Notification, Facebook Push Notification
Internet service providers provide access to the Internet
Application service providers provide access to a software or provides a service for a fee
Software as a Service (SaaS) is an example of ASPs where software is delivered to users for a fee
Software as a Service is “on-demand software”
Software can be for temporary or long-term use
Software as a Service only deals with software, not storage or hardware resources
