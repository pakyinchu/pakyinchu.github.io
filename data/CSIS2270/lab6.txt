A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a group of devices that are logically segmented by function, project team, or application, without regard to the physical locations of the users
In other words, VLANs are similar to physical LANs, but end stations can be grouped even if they are not physically located on the same LAN segment
A switch can be configured to support multiple VLANs, a VLAN can also be configured across multiple switches, and each VLAN is considered a logical network
Any broadcast packets are flooded only to end stations within a VLAN, and packets destined for stations that do not belong to the VLAN must be forwarded through a router
VLANs are usually associated with IP subnetworks such that all end stations in a particular VLAN belong to the same IP subnet
To communicate between VLANs, you must route the traffic through a router
VLAN trunking is used to inter-connect the VLANs on a number of switches
A trunk is a point-to-point link between two network devices that carries packets from more than one VLAN
With VLAN trunking, you can extend your configured VLANs across the entire network
Most Cisco switches supports the IEEE 802.1Q protocol used to coordinate trunks on both FastEthernet and GigabitEthernet ports
Since each VLAN operates as a separate subnet, layer 3 routing is needed to support communication between VLANs
Inter-VLAN routing is hence carried out by connecting a router to the switch infrastructure
Router-on-a-stick is a type of router configuration in which a single physical interface manages traffic between multiple VLANs on a network
The router interface has to be configured to operate as a trunk link and is connected to a switch port which has configured in trunk mode
The router uses an 802.1q trunk link to place multiple sub-interfaces for the VLANs using a single physical link
A Sub-Interface is a logical interface partitioned off from a physical interface allowing multiple interface configurations on a single physical interface
The router receives VLAN tagged traffic on the trunk interface from the switch, and forwards the routed traffic out to VLAN tagged destination using the same interface
Today, routing can be performed at hardware speeds; consequently, routing can be performed at the core and distribution layers without impacting network performance
Newer switch technologies, including multilayer switches (MLS) are available to help further improve the performance of computer networks
An example of a multilayer switch is a layer 3 switch (3560)
Layer 3 switches still work at layer 2 but also work at the network layer (layer 3) of the OSI model and use IP addressing for making decisions about routing a data packet in the best direction
The major difference is that the packet switching in basic routers is handled by a programmed microprocessor
A layer 3 switch uses application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware, to handle the packet switching
The advantages of using hardware to handle the packet switching is a significant reduction in processing time compared to using software for packet switching
In fact, the processing time of a layer 3 switches can be as fast as the input data rate
Because many users are in separate VLANs and each VLAN is usually a separate subnet
